# traveler_frontend
Frontend for Traveler app
A travel itinerary app

This is the frontend code for the app. It is written in Vanilla Javascript and custom CSS. Users can plan/add trips. After they add a trip they
will be able to search the area they are travelling to for bars, restaurants, museums, landmarks, or parks using calls to Yelp's api.
The user can click on events from the search to add to their itinerary.
